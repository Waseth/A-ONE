Having learned HTML and CSS, I will now focus on creating static but responsive webpages to solidify my skills.

# Day 5 - 1st August 2025

## Challenges faced

- Getting the hero section image to cover the full width of the screen on all devices
- I had trouble mastering the breakpoint ranges for different devices especially,tablets and laptops

---

## What I learned
- I learned that when styling webpages you are not restricted to using bootstrap utility classes alone.You can also custom CSS to override some of the bootstrap stylings
- I also managed to master the breakpoint ranges for these devices:

| Target Devices      | Breakpoint Range           | Media Query Example                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Tablets only**    | 768px (md) → 991.98px      | `@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991.98px)` |
| **Small laptops only** | 992px (lg) → 1199.98px   | `@media (min-width: 992px) and (max-width: 1199.98px)` |
| **Large phones only** | 576px (sm) → 767.98px    | `@media (min-width: 576px) and (max-width: 767.98px)` |

- I also noticed that .98 is used and it is to avoid overlapping of pixels when switching from screen to another
